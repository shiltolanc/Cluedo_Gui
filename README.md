# SWEN225-A2

Remote repository for SWEN225 assignment 2.

The system in the first assignment will be revamped for this assignment. So we will start from scratch and base the new
system on
our previously constructed ideas.

**TODO:**

* Rework the grid system to efficiently support the GUI (no more text-based input).
* Make new GUI.
* Condense down the methods (or build them up again from scratch).
* Move the methods into better classes.

**TASKS:**

* ʕ •ᴥ•ʔ will try to create the game characters.
